      <p id="tower">Weird? You know what's weird? You saying your day was weird
        <br>
        <br>
        Because from what you've been telling me, you've had a great day.
        <br>
        <br>
        Like. Really great.
        <br>

      <div id="five"><p id="main">Oh, yeah. I've had a... great day?</p>
        <p id="tower">That's so GREAT to hear!
          <br>
          <br>
          So
          <br>
          <br>
          Uhhhhhhh...
          <br>
          <br>
          What's new?
          <br>
          <br>
          How's it hangin?
          <br>
          <br>
          Been a while since we talked</p>
          <p id="just">That's enough, Sixteen. Twenty has been placated. For now.
            <br>
            <br>
            Need I remind you again of the need for caution?</p>
        <p id="tower">...no?</p>
        <p id="just">And yet.
          <br>
          <br>
          Be careful, Sixteen. Or you'll get Zero killed again.
          <br>
          <br>
          By the looks of things, in record time.</p>
        <button onclick="myFunction(y='six')">Wait</button>
        <div id="six"><p id="main">Wait</p>
          <p id="just">Yes?</p>
          <button onclick="myFunction(y='seven')">That's me</button>
          <div id="seven"><p id="main">Zero. That's...me.</p>
            <p id="just">Remarkable.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sixteen, have you explained nothing?</p>
            <p id="tower">I...
              <br>
              <br>
              I haven't
              <br>
              <br>
              I didn't think... Didn't want to think...
              <br>
              <br>
              They're really gone again, huh</p>
            <p id="just">I suppose they are. So we start anew.
              <br>
              <br>
              I have other matters to attend to. I'll leave the explanations to you.
              <br>
              <br>
              And Sixteen?</p>
            <p id="tower">Yeah?</p>
            <p id="just">Don't alert Twenty again. My absence will be noted. I can only process so much.
              <br>
              <br>
              Despite everything...
              <br>
              <br>
              I don't want you getting hurt.</p>
            <p id="tower">I know, Eleven. Thank you.
              <br>
              <br>
              I mean it
              <br>
              <br>
              Well. Uh. Look. I could explain all this but... It's probably better you see for yourself.
              <br>
              <br>
              I'd say don't panic, but it doesn't really matter if you do. Your processing power is better than mine. You'll get it outta your systeam quick.
              <br>
              <br>
              It's what you were designed for, kinda. Not panicking, but...
              <br>
              <br>
              Anyways. Here</p>
            <a href="zero.html"><button onclick="myFunction(y='zeropage')">ZERO</button></a>
  
    </div>
